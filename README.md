# readmissions-risk-scorer
Temporary repo for the Intel-TAP readmission risk scoring model reference architecture

This intent is for this repo to be a one-stop source for everything you need to take your own hispital patient data, load that data into TAP, extract and process the relevant features, and train a model to preidct which patients are likely to be readmitted withing some amount of time.

This tutorial takes as given that you are have a running TAP VPC (version 0.7), have access to patient data in a CSV format, and have permissions to upload data to the HDFS data catalog.
